Bought a RFM 433MHz:

Bought a breadboard (really need it?)
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008A9UORM/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Got RFM Realized I need power.

Bought battery-based one at RadioShack but 4.5 or 6V (same with AC/DC ones they had)

Q: Can I power with 4.5V? If not is 6V going to kill it?

Should I look into:

As mentioned at:

Simple batteries powered on breadboard seems to work fine, got signal in linein on my mac

now that electroincs seems to wrk, needs to read stream in and crack the code.
